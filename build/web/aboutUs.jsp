                    Welcome to JMU Idea Hub - a place where current students can connect
                    with alumni in an entrepreneurial environment that fosters collaboration
                    through the power of social networking.

                <p>
                    <div id="howItWorks">
                        So How Does It work?
                    </div>
                    Current students at James Madison University can sign up as 
                    "Futurepreneurs" - a combination of the words "future" and
                    "entrepreneur" - to post ideas that they might have for a
                    business, product, service, etc. Then, JMU alumni that are
                    registered as "Investors" can profess their admiration or interest
                    publicly by "supporting" or "commenting" on the ideas. Additionally,
                    if further discussion is desired, investors and futurepreneurs can
                    privately message one another to edit and revise the proposed ideas
                    or discuss logistics.

                    We hope that this site will act as the first stepping stone 
                    for many young, burgeoning entrepreneurs and provide a bridge
                    between the "academic world" and the "real world." We also
                    hope to establish long-lasting connections between fellow, like-
                    minded individuals who seek to innovate and contribute to the
                    greater good. In setting out to accomplish these goals, we
                    must provide a nurturing environment where ideas can grow from
                    infancy to maturity...ideas both big and small are welcomed!
                </p>

                    Unfortunately, it is difficult for many great ideas to "get off the ground."  
                    Usually, they just need a little help and that's precisely 
                    where JMU Idea Hub hopes to step in. After all, the world needs 
                    more fearless, novel ideas and we want to help build a future
                    where the students of today can truly lead the world of tomorrow!
